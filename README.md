# Personalized Fashion Recommendation System

This project implements a **machine learningâ€“based recommendation system** designed to personalize product suggestions for users, similar to the systems powering leading e-commerce platforms like Myntra.  
It combines **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** approaches to recommend products based on user preferences, browsing history, and interactions.

##  Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends products by analyzing item metadata (e.g., category, description, brand).  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Learns from historical user-item interactions to suggest new products.  
- **Hybrid Approach**: Flexibility to combine both methods for improved accuracy.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes precision/recall metrics for measuring recommendation quality.  
- **REST API**: Flask-based API for serving recommendations in real time.  
- **Modular Codebase**: Clean, production-style Python modules under `src/`.
